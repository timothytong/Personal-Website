                        <p>Hi, my name is Timothy Tong. I'm a Computer Engineering student from the University of Waterloo. I'm currently enrolled in my 2A academic term.</p>

                        <p>I consider myself a technology enthusiast. I love everything that deals with technology because all the electronic devices I've had have been working like magic to me, and I have always been fascinated and mesmerized by what they are capable of doing - they're making our lives so much easier and more enjoyable! Thus, I decided that it shall be my ultimate aspiration to unwrap and learn all about this mystery.</p>

                        <p>As a result of being so passionate about technology, I am interested in working with both hardware and software. In my spare time, I take the initiative to learn new languages and write apps. Last but not least, I constantly keep myself updated with the new products being debuted and important events being held in the technology arena.</p>

                        <p>Started from scratch, DMCalc is a powerful tool capable of solving discrete mathematics problems such as Linear Diophantine Equations and congruence. Applying the knowledge I obtained from school, and combining it with my self-taught learning of Objective-C, I have managed to create this simple yet useful calculator that could assist many students in their assignments and courses.</p>

                        <p>Though started with the interface builder, to date, most of DMCalc's UI has already been rewritten with solid code. Every element is generated programmatically, and positioned at the right place depending on the screen size of the device. And this is merely the beginning; more and more exciting features and functions are being added at the moment.</p>

                        <p>Based on, and inspired by the iOS version, I decided to collaborate with one of my best buddies <a href="http://www.victorszeto.com">Victor Szeto</a>. Together, we came up with an Android version of DMCalc to satisfy the needs of more students who don't own an Apple device. The process was, fortunately, far less challenging than the iOS version because we learned Java in high school and were exposed to Android during our first year in university. Moreover, the algorithms had already been developed.</p>

                        <p>DMCalc 2, which is currently in development, is the successor of DMCalc (1). It is all code-based, and is written in Swift, the newest programming language for iOS debuted by Apple back in June 2014. It will be written with more sophisticated code, and it will also bring users better UX with fancier animations and a customized hand-made keyboard!</p>

                        <h2>Zombie Killing Spree</h2>

                        <p>Zombie Killing Spree is a game I wrote in Java for my Grade 11 Computer Science final project. As a beginner programmer who could barely use <span>system.out.println</span> and <span>if</span> statements, I found this project particularly difficult at first; the goal was beyond reach. Challenging as it seemed at the beginning, as time went by, I gradually changed my way of looking at this project. Instead of deeming it as a heavy burden of work that I needed to bear, I started thinking of it as a gold mine - the deeper I dug into it, the more valuables I would be rewarded with, the more fun I would have, the more challenges I would overcome, and the more excitement I would experience. This is still how I think of learning nowadays, and I believe I will hold on to this thought for the rest of my life.</p>

                        <p>And of course, my hard work paid off in the end. Not only did I manage to finish the project independently, but the feedback from my teacher was also really amazing.</p>
